# Automation Randomizer
# IMPORTANT
## Requires .NET 6.0 Desktop!!!

## What is this for?
Don't know what to build in Automation? Want to impress friends with something weird or awesome in the next NeamMP session? Then this simple user-friendly tool is for you! Just select the options you want to randomly generate and choose a path for the text file after clicking "Generate!"
You now have unlimited possibilities right on your fingertips!
## What does "Exclude utility" mean?
It disables the appearance of utility-related markets and parts in generation
## What does everything else mean?
Try, and you'll know. Almost everything in the interface is functional
## What else do i need to know?
This is only the first version of the tool, and i'll be glad to hear the feedback. Comments, feature requests, etc should be submitted through issues, as i'll not be accepting **any** pull requests.
## Why go through this effort?
It's a relatively simple project, that didn't take up a lot of my time if any, i just wanted to have fun with it, and decided to share the fruits of my labour
## Your code is crap, you should fix it!
I know. Will do, eventually. For now i just wanted to get the tool out as fast as possible, so more people could have some fun with it
