# Automation Randomizer
## What is it?
This is a simple user-friendly program that allows users to generate descriptions of their next builds in the Automation game by Camshaft Software.
## What for?
Mostly, for my own use and to practice with code. I'm still very new to programming, and this... Thing is extremely rough around the edges.
## Okay, but how is it useful to others?
Generate some ideas and try to build them! Maybe export them into BeamNG, maybe try and complete the campaign with only random cars, who knows!
## What does "Exclude utility" mean?
It disables the appearance of utility-related markets in generation
## What does everything else mean?
Try, and you'll know. Almost everything in the interface is functional
## What else do i need to know?
This is only the first version of the tool, and i'll be glad to hear the feedback. Comments, feature requests, etc should be submitted through issues, as i'll not be accepting **any** pull requests.
## Your code is crap, you should fix it!
I know. Will do, eventually. For now i just wanted to get the tool out to have fun with friends
